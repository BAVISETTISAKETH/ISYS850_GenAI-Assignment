# Generative AI Assignment for ISYS 850

## Overview
This project explores the capabilities of two Generative AI tools, **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** and **Gemini**, in summarizing research articles. It aims to compare their performance across various metrics, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and analyze their applicability in different contexts.

## Objective
The primary goal of this assignment is to:
1. Summarize research articles from a specific domain using ChatGPT and Gemini.
2. Compare the quality, level of detail, focus, and usability of the summaries.
3. Highlight the differences in their outputs and analyze which tool is better suited for specific use cases.

---

## Repository Contents
The repository includes:
1. **PDFs/**: A collection of 10 research articles on anomaly detection, intrusion detection systems, and related machine learning topics.
2. **Summaries/**: Summaries generated by both ChatGPT and Gemini for each article.
3. **Comparative Analysis/**: A comprehensive comparison table highlighting the differences between the two tools.
4. **README.md**: Documentation of the project (this file).

## Process
### 1. Article Summarization
- Ten articles were selected in the domain of anomaly detection and intrusion detection.
- The following prompt was used for both ChatGPT and Gemini:
- Summaries from each tool are stored in their respective folders.

### 2. Comparative Analysis
- A detailed comparison was conducted based on the following aspects:
- **Level of Detail**: Technical depth and specificity of the summaries.
- **Focus and Emphasis**: Areas of concentration, such as methodologies or conceptual overviews.
- **Strengths and Weaknesses**: Insights into the tools' performance in different scenarios.
- **Use Cases**: Identification of scenarios where each tool is best suited.

## Key Findings
### 1. Level of Detail
- **ChatGPT**: Offers technical and detailed summaries, breaking down methodologies, metrics, and specific findings. Best for researchers and technical audiences.
- **Gemini**: Provides high-level, procedural summaries, focusing on concepts and challenges. More accessible to non-technical audiences.

### 2. Focus and Emphasis
- **ChatGPT**: Focuses on technical challenges, experimental results, and performance comparisons.
- **Gemini**: Highlights conceptual aspects, practical benefits, and general limitations.

### 3. Strengths
- **ChatGPT**:
- Excellent for detailed technical reviews and academic research.
- Includes quantitative results like accuracy and precision.
- Addresses emerging trends and knowledge gaps.
- **Gemini**:
- Simpler, more general summaries for a broader audience.
- Highlights broader applications and conceptual benefits.

### 4. Weaknesses
- **ChatGPT**:
- Can be overly technical for non-specialist audiences.
- Sometimes omits broader conceptual benefits.
- **Gemini**:
- Lacks technical depth and detailed experimental results.
- Occasionally repetitive in highlighting general advantages.
